# LameRPC
Crude and crappy jsonrpc class wrote in python for messing with electrum wallet. 
Really not meant to be used or seen by anyone else.
The python code is definitely not python-esque, its just cobbled together. Leave me alone.

Everything is a lie. Especially this repo. The module is named rpc_service which it isn't one.
The repo is named lamerpc AS IF it ever could be extended beyond using with electrum wallet.
